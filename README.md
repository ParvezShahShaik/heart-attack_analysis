# Heart Attack Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on the analysis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of death globally. The data analysis utilizes visualization methods such as plots, charts, and tables to tell a story with the data, making it easy and effective for communication. The objective is to identify causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks effectively.

### Domain
Healthcare

## Data Understanding
Refer to the separate Excel file with the data dictionary provided to build your understanding of the dataset, which includes various factors that might impact heart health.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data
1. **Preliminary Data Inspection**:
   - Report findings on the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates if found.
   - Treat missing values using an appropriate strategy.
3. **Statistical Summary**:
   - Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data. Explore measures of central tendencies and the spread of the data.

### Task 2: Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
4. **Categorical Variables**:
   - Identify which data variables are categorical. Describe and explore these using appropriate visualization tools (e.g., count plots).
5. **Age Analysis**:
   - Study the occurrence of CVD across different ages.
6. **Blood Pressure Analysis**:
   - Investigate if a heart attack can be detected based on anomalies in the resting blood pressure of patients.
7. **Gender Analysis**:
   - Analyze the composition of patients with respect to gender.

### Task 3: Advanced EDA and Modeling
8. **Cholesterol and CVD**:
   - Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and the occurrence of heart attacks.
9. **Exercise and Heart Attack**:
   - Conclude the relationship between peak exercising and the occurrence of a heart attack.
10. **Thalassemia and CVD**:
    - Determine if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD and how other factors contribute to CVD.
11. **Pair Plot Analysis**:
    - Use a pair plot to understand the relationship between all given variables.
12. **Logistic Regression Model**:
    - Perform logistic regression, predict outcomes for test data, and validate the results using a confusion matrix.

### Task 4: Dashboarding
13. **Visualization Using Tableau**:
    - Visualize variables to distinguish between attributes of a Diseased vs. a Healthy person using Tableau.
14. **Dashboard Development**:
    - Demonstrate the variables associated with each other and factors to build an insightful dashboard.
